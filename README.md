This repository houses [default community health files](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file) for [GitHub repositories](https://www.github.com/FCP-INDI) for the [1000 Functional Connectomes Project, the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative and the Computational Neuroimaging Lab at the Child Mind Institute](https://fcp-indi.github.io).

If an FCP-INDI repository includes any community health files, those in that repository will appear instead of these defaults. Otherwise, these defaults appear.

When an FCP-INDI repository is forked or cloned, the organization default community health files will not appear in the copy. Any repository-specific community health files will appear in the copy.
